# flow-builder

flow-builder provides an open source frontend for authoring [flow interoperability project specification](https://floip.gitbook.io/flow-specification/) compliant flows. It enables the importing, editing and exporting of flow json, as well as authoring from scratch. Such flows can then be run using a compatible flow runner such as [FLOIP/flow-runner](https://github.com/FLOIP/flow-runner).
