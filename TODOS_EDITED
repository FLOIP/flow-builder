Misc unclear/questions



Big issues - not nice to haves, not architecture or code improvements


//GOT TO HERE

src/store/flow/block.ts|100 col 7| //TODO - handle other props apart from test

Block todos - non urgent

src/store/flow/index.ts|3 col 34| import {IRootState} from '..' // todo: create factory with generics so that IRootState is DI'd
src/store/flow/index.ts|36 col 45| nestedFlowBlockInteractionIdStack: [], // todo: not quite right -- pulled from IContext

Base store todos - non urgent

src/store/flow/flow.ts|62 col 8| // todo: convert this whole operation to an ActionTree member
src/store/flow/flow.ts|63 col 8| // todo: use mutations for these:
src/store/flow/flow.ts|137 col 10| // todo: for some reason {snakeCase} from 'lodash' doesn't work?
src/store/flow/flow.ts|138 col 10| // todo: for some reason dynamic imports aren't working w/ storybook build

flow store stuff

src/router/trees.js|1 col 4| // todo: children of /trees base url
src/router/index.ts|23 col 6| // todo: rename trees module + url path to builder + add extensible children as intx-design & resource-viewer

router stuff

src/store/flow/block-types/MobilePrimitives_SelectOneResponseBlockStore.ts|116 col 6| // todo: in the flow-spec, there's mention that we can configure to swap between exit-per-choice and a default exit

select one ticket

src/store/flow/block-types/ConsoleIO_ReadBlockStore.ts|16 col 8| // TODO: correct the destination variables array according to scanf library we're using, and think about consecutive % or other error we should avoid

scanf bugs - think about edge cases

src/components/interaction-designer/block-editors/NameEditor.vue|26 col 9| //TODO - where should this come from - here and in other cases? Platform metadata? Need to write a story for this mode

Recheck master after merges - more todos?
Go through all once classified and double check - was any of it actually secretly urgent?
create pr for deleted - remove todos file
double check the ask is clear with all of these once we've gone through
clarify in the tickets - do and then delete todo, search by todo text as they were deduped and may be identical in several places
write ticket for unclear todos
